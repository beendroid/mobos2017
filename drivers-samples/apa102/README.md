RGB LED strip (APA102) sample for Android Things
================================================

This Android Things sample demonstrates how to interface with a basic 
RGB led strip using the APA102 over SPI protocol.


Pre-requisites
--------------

- Android Things compatible board
- Android Studio 2.2+
- [Rainbow Hat for Android Things](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/rainbow-hat-for-android-things) or the following individual components:
    - 1 [APA102 compatible RGB Led strip](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2241)
    - jumper wires

Schematics
----------

If you have the Raspberry Pi [Rainbow Hat for Android Things](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/rainbow-hat-for-android-things), just plug it onto your Raspberry Pi 3.

The 5v and GND from the Edison and Raspberry Pi 3 are sufficient for driving a few LEDs,
connect these pins to the power pins on the APA102 connector.

Build and install
=================

On Android Studio, edit the `MainActivity.java` file and set the correct number
of LEDs in your LED strip (constant `NUM_LEDS`).

Then, click on the "Run" button.

If you prefer to run on the command line, from this repository's root directory, type

```bash
./gradlew apa102:installDebug
adb shell am start com.example.androidthings.driversamples/.MainActivity
```

The LEDs will blink in various patterns.

Troubleshooting
=================

For a strip with more than a few LEDs, use an external power adapter for your
board, or power the LED strip from an external power source.
