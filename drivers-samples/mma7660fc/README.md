Accelerometer sample for Android Things
=======================================

This Android Things sample demonstrates how to use the MMA7660FC accelerometer
sensor and integrates it into the Android sensor framework.

Pre-requisites
--------------

- Android Things compatible board
- Android Studio 2.2+
- 1 [MMA7660FC based accelerometer](http://wiki.seeed.cc/Grove-3-Axis_Digital_Accelerometer-1.5g/)
- jumper wires
- 1 breadboard


Schematics
----------

Build and install
=================

On Android Studio, click on the "Run" button.

If you prefer to run on the command line, from this repository's root directory, type

```bash
./gradlew mma7660fc:installDebug
adb shell am start com.example.androidthings.driversamples/.AccelerometerDemo
```

If you have everything set up correctly, a log will be generated on logcat
whenever there is an accelerometer sensor update.

Notice that the Accelerometer driver integrates with the Android sensor
framework using a user driver and fuses with other sensors, so
the part of the app that handles the sensor updates works exactly the same
no matter which, or how many accelerometer sources are available.
