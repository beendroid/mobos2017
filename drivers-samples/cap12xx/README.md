Capacitive touch sample for Android Things
============================================

This Android Things sample demonstrates how to connect to a Capacitive Touch
sensor based on a CAP12xx microchip and how to integrate it to the
Android framework using an InputDriver.


Pre-requisites
--------------

- Android Things compatible board
- Android Studio 2.2+
- 1 capacitive touch sensor based on a CAP12xx microchip like the
  [Pimoroni Explorer Hat](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2427)
- jumper wires
- 1 breadboard


Schematics
----------

If using the [Raspberry Pi Explorer Hat]((https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/explorer-hat), just plug it onto your Raspberry Pi 3.


Build and install
=================

On Android Studio, click on the "Run" button.

If you prefer to run on the command line, from this repository's root directory, type

```bash
./gradlew cap12xx:installDebug
adb shell am start com.example.androidthings.driversamples/.CaptouchActivity
```

If you have everything set up correctly, pressing any of the 8 capacitive
buttons labeled 1 to 8 on the Explorer Hat will log the corresponding button
label to logcat.

Notice that the Cap12xx driver integrates with the Android framework using an
InputDriver user driver and simulates regular key presses, so the part of the
app that handles the button presses works exactly the same as if it was a
regular keyboard generating the key presses.
