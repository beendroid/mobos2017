Build and install
=================

On Android Studio, click on the "Run" button.

If you prefer to run on the command line, from this repository's root directory, type

```bash
./gradlew pwmspeaker:installDebug
adb shell am start com.example.androidthings.driversamples/.SpeakerActivity
```

If you have everything set up correctly, you will hear the speaker play a
series of notes. To play the tune again, re-run the app from AndroidStudio.
If you prefer the command line, run again with

```bash
adb shell am start -S com.example.androidthings.driversamples/.SpeakerActivity
```
