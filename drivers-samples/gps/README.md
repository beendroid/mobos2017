UART GPS sample for Android Things
==================================

This Android Things sample demonstrates how to connect to a GPS unit that
emits data via UART in the NMEA format, and integrates it into the Android
location framework.


Pre-requisites
--------------

- Android Things compatible board
- Android Studio 2.2+
- 1 GPS NMEA-compatible module with UART interface, like the
  [Ultimate GPS hat](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2324)
- jumper wires
- 1 breadboard


Schematics
----------

If using the [Raspberry Pi Ultimate GPS Hat](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2324), just plug it onto your
Raspberry Pi 3.


Build and install
=================

On Android Studio, click on the "Run" button.

If you prefer to run on the command line, from this repository's root directory, type

```bash
./gradlew gps:installDebug
adb shell am start com.example.androidthings.driversamples/.GpsActivity
```

If you have everything set up correctly, a log will be generated on logcat
whenever there is a location update.

Notice that the GPS driver integrates with the Android location framework
using a GpsDriver user driver and fuses with other location sources, so
the part of the app that handles the location updates works exactly the same
no matter which, or how many location sources are available.
