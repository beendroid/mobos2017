Android Things.

Pre-requisites

Build and install
=================

On Android Studio, click on the "Run" button.

If you prefer to run on the command line, from this repository's root directory, type

```bash
./gradlew ssd1306:installDebug
adb shell am start com.example.androidthings.driversamples/.OledScreenActivity
```

If you have everything set up correctly, you will see a small bitmap slowly
moving in the screen. If you want to change the pattern displayed, change the
variable mMode in OledScreenActivity and deploy again. The sample has three
modes: DOTS, BITMAP (default) and CROSSHAIRS.
